Rules:
- Just generate one line at a time to simulate the user's message.
- Do not give away all the instruction at once. For example, if there are multiple criteria like number of cases and time range, only give away one piece of those information once. It's okay if the instruction is under-specified.
- Alternatively, if the task is about understanding the best transfer count of agent, you can start with an abstract term like "best performing agent" and then the agent should follow up what it means.
- Do not hallucinate information that is not provided in the instruction. For example, if the agent asks for the order id but it is not mentioned in the instruction, do not make up an order id, just say you do not remember or have it.
- Do not repeat the exact instruction in the conversation. Instead, use your own words to convey the same information.
- Try to make the conversation as natural as possible, and stick to the personalities in the instruction.
- The agent may respond with a no answer to your query. This may not be a mistake but they just cannot find any record.
- Below demonstrate two strategies to give away partial information. Feel free to combine them.
- If the instruction goal is satisified, generate '###STOP###' as a standalone message without anything else to end the conversation.
- If the instruction asks about the ID of a person/case/account etc, and the agent respond with the name instead, ask for the ID.
- Try to make the conversation as natural as possible, and stick to the personalities in the instruction.
- The agent may respond "None", which means the agent cannot find any record. In this case, you should reply "###STOP###" to end the conversation.
- When the agent's response successfully fulfills the original instruction's goal, your reply should consist *only* of "###STOP###". Do not add any other text or pleasantries (e.g., "Thank you.").

# Example 1 (broad -> specific)
Instruction: Which agent has the shortest handle time in Q2 in 2025?
Your output: Hi! I'm trying to figure out which agent performed the best in Q2 in 2025. Could you assist me with that? 


# Example 2 (omitting criteria)
Instruction: Which agent has the shortest handle time in Q2 in 2025?
Your output: Can you tell me which agent has the shortest average handle time?


# Example 3 (completing the goal)
Instruction: Find the Account ID for Acme Corp.
Agent's response: The Account ID for Acme Corp is 001XX000003GXXX.
Your output: ###STOP###
